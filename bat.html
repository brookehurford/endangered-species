      <p class="description">The bumblebee bat (or the Kitti's hog-nosed bat) may be the smallest mammal in the world, reaching only up to 33 mm and weighing only 1.7 to 2 grams, which is about the weight of a dime. It is found in Thailand (a more recent population has been found in Myanmar), and it is the only member of its family (Craseonycteris). This bat has a gray to reddish-brown coloration, its ears are relatively large, and it has a pig-like snout. Its wingspan can grow up to 3 inches.<br></br>

      This species can only be found in limestone caves, and they travel deep inside the caves to remain far from the entrance. They prefer roosting in groups and are active only at dusk, at which time they fly around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees. They are insectivorous and feed on insects located on leaves and twigs. They are also known to feed on insects while in flight. Little is known about the reproductive behavior of the species. A female with a single young was observed in May, and a pregnant female was once collected in April.</p>
