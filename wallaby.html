      <p class="description">The bridled nail-tailed wallaby was once thought to be extinct until rediscovered in 1973 in an area near Queensland. Today it is only found in the Taunton Scientific Reserve of northeastern Australia, and recently, a population was released into Idalia National Park. This creature gets its name from the white "bridle" line that starts on the center of the neck and goes around the shoulders and ending at the forearms on each side. It also possesses a black stripe on its back that runs across the whole body. Another distinguishing feature is its "nail" (horny spur) on the end of its tail that is partially covered by hair. Males are larger than females and can weigh up to 282 lbs. Females can weigh up to 176 lbs.</p>
